# Script that installs, removes and / or sources a CMSSW environment. Distinctions are made
# depending on whether the installation is already present, and whether the script is called as part
# of a remote (law) job (AP_REMOTE_JOB=1).
#
# Five environment variables are expected to be set before this script is called:
#   - AP_SCRAM_ARCH: The scram architecture string.
#   - AP_CMSSW_VERSION: The desired CMSSW version to setup.
#   - AP_CMSSW_BASE: The location where the CMSSW environment should be installed.
#   - AP_CMSSW_ENV_NAME: The name of the environment to prevent collisions between multiple
#                        environments using the same CMSSW version.
#   - AP_CMSSW_FLAG: An incremental integer value stored in the installed CMSSW environment to
#                    detect whether it needs to be updated.
#
# Arguments:
# 1. mode: The setup mode. Different values are accepted:
#   - '' (default): The CMSSW environment is installed when not existing yet and sourced.
#   - clear: The CMSSW environment is removed when existing.
#   - reinstall: The CMSSW environment is removed first, then reinstalled and sourced.
#   - install_only: The CMSSW environment is installed when not existing yet but not sourced.
#
# Note on remote jobs:
# When the AP_REMOTE_JOB variable is found to be "1" (usually set by a remote job bootstrap script),
# no mode is supported and an error is printed when it is set to a non-empty value. In any case, no
# installation will happen but the desired CMSSW setup is re-used depending on the type of job
# environment.
# In general, two types of job environments are handled: environments with full access to the file
# system used for job submission (e.g. HTCondor with "getenv"), and newly created environments with
# no connection to the submitting machine (WLCG jobs, HTCondor without "getenv").
# In the former case (AP_REMOTE_NEWENV!=1), the CMSSW environment must be present and accessible in
# order to be sourced.
# In the latter case (AP_REMOTE_NEWENV=1),a precompiled CMSSW bundle is fetched from a local or
# remote location and unpacked. TODO: explain which variables are used to determine the location
